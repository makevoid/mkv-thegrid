# TheGrid MKV


status: **WIP**

**note:** this is a work in progress

**notes (extended):**

`auth.coffee` used for login (source repo of the original auth.coffee vendored in this repo: https://github.com/the-grid/apidocs/blob/master/code-examples/coffeescript/auth.coffee ) ---> command: grid (needs alias to be installed, otherwise ruby grid_mkv.rb)

----


TheGrid now makes damn cool websites just by passing anything into it (video, picture, text, link, social stream, filtered social stream like by tag etc...)

### project target


You can create a website from just content (links + metadata) with a shell command + some clicks in thegrid app



----

The target of this project

```
grid http://example.com
grid http://antani.com
```

|
v

you publish from the app (few clicks, just select the site you want to publish to)


----

idea:

it creates a cordova app with the content from the site + an android apk


----


#  This repo 

this repo, other than the information of creating websites , gives you a command as an alias (evn if it should package a binary in the future for simplicity / ease of use (no need to setup language or dependencies)

Why create a docker container at all when you can create a binary? (compilation happens on architecture - libraries not linking problem)



----

### my thegrid.io autogenerated websites

### Config

The sites get generated automatically with content and layout infos stored in the site SAF files (`site-SITENAME.saf`)

They get published via thegrid API.

### Authenticate

Use the coffeescript `auth.coffe` programs/script to authenticate to get an auth token

run:

    THEGRID_APP_ID=your_uuid THEGRID_APP_SECRET=xxxxx coffee publish/auth.coffee

with my app uuid:

    THEGRID_APP_ID=e51b880c-8b87-46e8-83af-feb6dffc6f0b THEGRID_APP_SECRET=$THEGRID_KEY coffee publish/auth.coffee

in my case, because I exported that in an environment variable I have ($THEGRID_KEY), so I can regenerate easily tokens to keep posting on the grid :D

FIY that's the export command I put in my ~/.bashrc

    export THEGRID_KEY="xxxxxx"

(the infos reported here can be found in the original coffeescript module)

##### Then:

visit <http://localhost:3000>, click the blue link, log in and obtain the token (you can hit CTRL-C to shutdown the server and run the export command to export the token)

### Setup

  gem i hashie


### Run it

    TOKEN=$THEGRID_TOKEN ruby grid_mkv.rb


### DNS

Of course you can setup your DNS records manually, but I like to do it via API, so I have a `dns.rb` script to do that.

Install the prereqs.

    gem i dnsimple

Run the script

    ruby lib/dns.rb

You need to add `config/dnsimple_token.txt` (general API token, not domain token) and then configure your domain directly into `lib/dns.rb`


### Sites:

Each site took ~5 minutes to create

##### <https://thegrid.ai/mkv-projects/>
##### <https://thegrid.ai/mkv-blockchain/>
##### <https://thegrid.ai/mkv-dev/>
##### <https://thegrid.ai/mkv-photos/>


I did some editing afterwards, but it was minimal.

When I wrote this readme and the `grid` script originally, thegrid.ai was not as good as it is now.

---


TODO: package the `grid` script as a binary

feedback:

> - awesome, publish the first version of the site via api and see it automatically layout-ed :D
> - needs global cdn, the current one sometimes is slow in europe
