# TheGrid MKV

### my thegrid.io autogenerated websites

### Config

The sites get generated automatically with content and layout infos stored in the site SAF files (`site-SITENAME.saf`)

They get published via thegrid API.

### Setup

  gem i hashie


### Run it

    ruby grid_mkvd.rb


### DNS

Of course you can setup your DNS records manually, but I like to do it via API, so I have a `dns.rb` script to do that.

Install the prereqs.

    gem i dnsimple

Run the script

    ruby lib/dns.rb

You need to add `config/dnsimple_token.txt` (general API token, not domain token) and then configure your domain directly into `lib/dns.rb`


### Sites:

Each site took ~5 minutes to create
