# TheGrid MKV

### my thegrid.io autogenerated websites

### Config

The sites get generated automatically with content and layout infos stored in the site SAF files (`site-SITENAME.saf`)

They get published via thegrid API.

### Authenticate

Use the coffeescript `auth.coffe` programs/script to authenticate to get an auth token

run:

    THEGRID_APP_ID=your_uuid THEGRID_APP_SECRET=xxxxx coffee publish/auth.coffee

with my app uuid:

    THEGRID_APP_ID=e51b880c-8b87-46e8-83af-feb6dffc6f0b THEGRID_APP_SECRET=$THEGRID_KEY coffee publish/auth.coffee

in my case, because I exported that in an environment variable I have ($THEGRID_KEY), so I can regenerate easily tokens to keep posting on the grid :D

FIY that's the export command I put in my ~/.bashrc

    export THEGRID_KEY="xxxxxx"

##### Then:

visit <http://localhost:3000>, click the blue link, log in and obtain the token (you can hit CTRL-C to shutdown the server and run the export command to export the token)

### Setup

  gem i hashie


### Run it

    TOKEN=$THEGRID_TOKEN ruby grid_mkv.rb


### DNS

Of course you can setup your DNS records manually, but I like to do it via API, so I have a `dns.rb` script to do that.

Install the prereqs.

    gem i dnsimple

Run the script

    ruby lib/dns.rb

You need to add `config/dnsimple_token.txt` (general API token, not domain token) and then configure your domain directly into `lib/dns.rb`


### Sites:

Each site took ~5 minutes to create
